title: Exercises for Discussion 
---

### Guidelines

- **Presentation:** The assigned presenter is expected to lead the discussion on the exercises and examples, delivering a mini-lecture. You are welcome to add additional notes or content to the notebooks.

- **Duration:** Aim for a presentation length of approximately 15â€“20 minutes.

- **Scheduling:** I will confirm the presenters for the upcoming week every Monday or Tuesday.

- **Substitution:** If a presenter is unavailable (e.g., due to dropping the class), the next person in line will take their place.

- **Order:** Presentation orders are determined by random shuffling using the code provided below.

```python
import random

# Define the list of students
students = [
    "FallahiFard, Behzad",
    "Galicia Lona, Axel",
    "Jones, Nathalie",
    "Lee, Wonkeun",
    "Li, Chuanman",
    "Lin, Pei-Ling",
    "Lin, Ying",
    "Liu, Linlin",
    "Liu, Yuxin",
    "Lopez, Nancy",
    "Olawole, Alice",
    "Qu, Xinhao",
    "Tang, Luhan",
    "Wang, Kaiming",
    "Wu, Yifan",
    "Xue, Yijia",
    "Yang, Chenguang",
    "Zhou, Bufan"
]

# Shuffle the list randomly
random.shuffle(students)
# Print out the random order
print("Random order of students:")
for index, student in enumerate(students, start=1):
    print(f"{index}: {student}")
```
