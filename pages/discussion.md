title: Exercises for Discussion 
---

### Guidelines

- **Presentation:** The assigned presenter is expected to lead the discussion on the exercises and examples, delivering a mini-lecture. You are welcome to add additional notes or content to the notebooks.

- **Duration:** Aim for a presentation length of approximately 15â€“20 minutes.

- **Scheduling:** I will confirm the presenters for the upcoming week every Monday or Tuesday.

- **Substitution:** If a presenter is unavailable (e.g., due to dropping the class), the next person in line will take their place.

- **Order:** Presentation orders are determined by random shuffling using the code provided below.
