    "The secant method has the advantage of fast convergence.  While the bisection method has a linear convergence rate (i.e. error goes to zero at the rate that $h(x) = x$ goes to zero, the secant method has a convergence rate that is faster than linear, but not quite quadratic (i.e. $\\sim x^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}2 \\approx 1.6$) however, the trade-off is that the secant method is not guaranteed to find a root in the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variant of the secant method is known as the **method of false positions**. Conceptually it is identical to the secant method, except that instead of always using the last two values of $x$ for linear interpolation, it chooses the two most recent values that maintain the bracket property (i.e $f(a) f(b) < 0$). It is slower than the secant, but like the bisection, is safe."
